#To Do:
#At the top of this file:
#Add appropriate comments for your name, date, program description, etc.
#
#For each line of code below:
#   write a comment above it describing what the expression evaluates to and why.
#   You may use the shell to help you and check your work.
#Follow the appropriate style from my examples and the web article
#
#Submit your modified version of this file to d2l by the due date.


#Examples:

#This line evaluates to 90 because subtracting 10 from 100 gives you 90.
100 - 10
print(100 - 10)

#This line evaluates to true because 100 is greater than 10.
100 > 10
print(100 > 10)
#Worth 10 points each:

#This line evaluates to 4 because adding 2 from 2 gives you 4.
2+2
print(2 + 2)
#This line evaluates to 3.0 because dividing 12 from 4 gives you 3 with the added decimal point.
12/4
print(12/4)
#This line evaluates to 0 because there is no remainder when you divide 8 and 2. 
8%2
print(8%2)
#This line evaluates to 694 because 100 is multipled by 7 which equals to 700 and then its subtracted by 4.
100*7-4
print(100*7-4)
#This line is equal to 300 because it follows the order of operations, so 7 minus 4 equals 3, times 100.
100*(7-4)
print(100*(7-4))
#This line is equal to 5 because it follows the order of operations, so 8 + 9 = 17, and the remainder of 80 divided by 17 is 12, so 12 - 7 equals 5.
80%(8+9)-7
print(80%(8+9)-7)
#This line evaluates to true because 10 is breater than 7
10 > 7
print(10 > 7)
#This line evaluates to true because 20 is greater than OR equal to 20
20 <= 20
print(20 <= 20)
#This line evaluates to false because both of these expressions are not true. AND requires both expressions to be true.
20 != 30 and 10 == 7
print(20 != 30 and 10 == 7)

#This line evalautes to true because at least one of the two expressions are true, which is what OR needs for it to be true. 
100 > 98+2 or 7%2 == 1
print(100 > 98+2 or 7%2 == 1)
#BONUS: Modify this code to display the result of each line to the user through the console when this file is run
#       (there are several ways to do this).
